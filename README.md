# TurboRepo Monorepo Example

This monorepo includes a **Next.js app** and a **React + Vite app** with shared packages.

> ⚠️ **Requires `pnpm`** to manage dependencies.

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have `pnpm` installed, then run:

```bash
pnpm install
```

This will install all dependencies for both apps and shared packages.

### 2. Run the Apps in Development

Start both the Next.js and React + Vite apps:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

This will start Next.js and React + Vite simultaneously.

You can access the apps in your browser at their respective ports (check terminal output for URLs).
